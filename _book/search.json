Comments will offer an understanding of the mark awarded and identify areas which can be considered for improvement in future assignments.\nVerbal face-to-face feedback. Immediate face-to-face feedback will be provided during computer, discussion and clinic sessions in interaction with staff. This will take place in all live sessions during the semester.\nOnline forum. Asynchronous written feedback will be provided via an online forum. Students are encouraged to contribute by asking and answering questions relating to the module content. Staff will monitor the forum Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, but it will be open to students to make contributions at all times. Response time will vary depending on the complexity of the question and staff availability."

    "section": "1.5 Assessment",
    "text": "1.5 Assessment\nThe final module mark is composed of the two computational essays. Together they are designed to cover the materials introduced in the entirety of content covered during the semester. A computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and computational results that are included in the essay itself. Each teaching week, you will be required to address a set of questions relating to the module content covered in that week, and to use the material that you will produce for this purpose to build your computational essay.\nAssignment 1 (50%) refer to the set of questions at the end of Chapters ?sec-chp2, ?sec-chp3, ?sec-chp4 and ?sec-chp5. You are required to use your responses to build your computational essay. Each chapter provides more specific guidance of the tasks and discussion that you are required to consider in your assignment.\nAssignment 2 (50%) refer to the set of questions at the end of Chapters ?sec-chp6, ?sec-chp7, ?sec-chp8, ?sec-chp9 and ?sec-chp10. You are required to use your responses to build your computational essay. Each chapter provides more specific guidance of the tasks and discussion that you are required to consider in your assignment.\n\n1.5.1 Format Requirements\nBoth assignments will have the same requirements:\nMaximum word count: 2,000 words, excluding figures and references. Up to three maps, plot or figures (a figure may include more than one map and/or plot and will only count as one but needs to be integrated in the figure) Up to two tables. Assignments need to be prepared in R Notebook format and then converted into a self-contained HTML file that will then be submitted via Turnitin. The notebook should only display content that will be assessed. Intermediate steps do not need to be displayed. Messages resulting from loading packages, attaching data frames, or similar messages do not need to be included as output code. Useful resources to customise your R notebook can be found on the R Markdown website from RStudio: * A Guide * R Markdown: The Definitive Guide by Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund (2018) * R Markdown Reference Guide\nTwo R Notebook templates will be available via the module Canvas site.\nSubmission is electronic only via Turnitin on Canvas."
