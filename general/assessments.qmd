# Assessments: General Remarks {.unnumbered}

## Submission
Please follow these templates consistently: 

- [Assignment I](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/blob/main/templates/Assignment1_template.ipynb)

- [Assignment II](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/blob/main/templates/Assignment2_template.ipynb)


Download the template as follows:
<img src = "../img/raw.png" width="80%">
and edit them accordingly.

You will submit through Canvas a `.html` file obtained from a Python  `.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file. To do so, in your `.ipynb` file, follow these steps: `File` --> `Save and Export as..` --> `HTML`. Prior to this step, the notebook needs to be rendered (i.e. all the cells should be executed). 

**Other file formats will not be accepted**.  

**Important for Assignment II, before exporting your `.ipynb` to a `.html` file: follow the steps described in the template to include an interactive dashboard in the static `html` that will be sumbitted as your assignment. This is to guarantee that your dashboard works in the submission file. You are responsible of your dashboard working as expected.** 

## Marking Criteria

This course follows the standard marking criteria (the general ones and those relating to GIS assignments in particular) set by the School of Environmental Sciences. Please make sure to check the student handbook and familiarise with them. In addition to these generic criteria, the following specific criteria will be used in cases where computer code is part of the work being assessed:

## DOs and DONTs

- Do not include "temporary" maps unless you really need to specifically show something to your reader.  
- Do not include maps that have no actual differences, apart from few things (e.g. you changed the zoom level).
- Mix the accompanying text, in markdown cells, with the code. 
- Do not include all the text at the beginning. 
- Provide some theoretical context and motivation to your topic.
- Present 2 or 3 NICE maps and the final interactive map (Assignment I) and the one included in your dashboard (Assignment II)
