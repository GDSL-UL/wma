# Install Miniconda Mac {.unnumbered}

*Install Miniconda on your personal Laptop: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html), depending on your OS. 
During the installation, leave the default settings. In particular, when asked whom to "Install Miniconda for", choose "Just for me".

## Set up the Miniconda Environment

1. Type in the search bar and open `Terminal`. Launch it, and write `conda update`.
2. Download the [envs456.yml](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/blob/main/envs456.yml) from github.
3. Create a `Webmapping` folder for the course and place the `.yml` in it. Then in `Terminal` write `conda env create -n envs456 --file envs456.yml` and press `Enter`. This will need to be modified according to where you placed the `Webmapping` folder.
For example: Elisabetta has named her folder `ENVS456` and it's in her Dropbox in `Users/PIETROST/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/ENVS456/envs456.yml`

If you created the `Webmapping` folder on your desktop, the path would be `Desktop/Webmapping`.

4. If you are prompted any questions, press `y`. This process will install all the packages necessary to carry out the lab sessions.

## Prepare the Lab Data
1. Download the [data](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/data) and the [images](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/img) to run and render the jupyter notebooks. 
2. Unzip the folders and move the nested folders into the folder `Webmapping`.

It should look something like this:

2. Place th jupyternotebook in a `labs` folder in side your `Webmapping` folder. Your `Webmapping` folder should at least contain a `data` and a `labs` folder.
3. Open `Terminal`.
4. In `Terminal` write `conda activate envs456` and press `Enter`. This activates your working environment.
5. Write and run `jupyter notebook`. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your default browser.
