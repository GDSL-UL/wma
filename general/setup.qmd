# Setting up the Working Environment {.unnumbered}

Follow the instructions for yuour Operating System and test your installation **prior to the first Lab Session** (Wed, 31st of January). If you experience any issues, write a message on the Ms Teams channel of the module.
Setting up the Python environment is necessary for:

- Executing the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) of the Lab sessions of the course.
- Preparing your own Jupyter Notebooks for the assignments (one each).

We will use `Minconda` to handle our working environment. *Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others)*
