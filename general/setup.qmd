# Setting up the Working Environment {.unnumbered}

Follow the instructions for yuour Operating System and test your installation. If you experience any issues, write a message on the Ms Teams channel of the module.
Setting up the Python environment is necessary for:

- Executing the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) of the Lab sessions of the course.
- Preparing your own Jupyter Notebooks for the assignments (one each).

We will use `Minconda` to handle our working environment. *Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages (like pip, zlib, and a few others)*

## Set up Miniconda (and Python) on Ms Windows {.unnumbered}

### Installation {.unnumbered}

1. Install Miniconda:
	- *Option 1*: On a UoL Machine: Download and install Miniconda from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe). This will install Miniconda and Python in `C:\`. If this process is aborted because it requires administrator rights, press `Start`, select `Install University Applications`, type and choose `Miniconda`.
	- *Option 2*, **Recommended**: Install Miniconda on your personal Laptop: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).
2. During the installation, leave the default settings. In particular, when asked whom to "Install Miniconda for", choose "Just for me".

**Important:** If you do choose to work on University Machines you will have to reinstall `Miniconda` every lab session unless you use a PC where Miniconda has been installed already. 

**Alternatively**, you can work on the lab notebooks directly on the web. This does not require to install `Miniconda`. However, it represents a much slower option, especially when setting up the environment. To do so, you can access the data and the lab notebooks in the `\labs` directory from a virtual copy of the course repository [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GDSL-UL/wma/HEAD). If you opt for this option, you do not need to follow the rest of the instructions below.

### Set up the Directories {.unnumbered}

1. Create a folder where you want to keep your work conducted throughout this course. For example, call it `envs456`. You can save it wherever you want. If you are working on a university machine, it could be worth creating it in `M:/`, which should your "virtual" hard-disk.
2. Download the [data](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/data) and the [images](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/labs_img) for running and rendering the jupyter notebooks. 
3. Unzip the folders and move the nested folders into the folder `envs456`.
4. Create another folder called `labs`

The folder structure should look like:

```
envs456/
├── data/
├── labs_img/
└── labs/
```

### Set up the Python Environment {.unnumbered}

1. Download the `envs456.yml` from GitHub by cliciking `Download raw file`, top right [at this page](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/blob/main/envs456.yml) 
2. Save it in the folder `envs456` created before.
3. Type in the search bar and find the `Anaconda Prompt (miniconda 3)`. Launch it. The terminal should appear.

<img src = "../img/windows_anaconda.png" width="80%">

3. In the **Anaconda Terminal** write:  `conda env create -n envs456 --file C:\envs456\envs456.yml` and press `Enter`; if the file is located elsewhere you'll need to use the corresponding file path.
4. If you are prompted any questions, press `y`. This process will install all the packages necessary to carry out the lab sessions.
5. In the **Anaconda Terminal** write `conda activate envs456` and press `Enter`. This activates your working environment.
6. *Necessary* on University machines, otherwise *Optional*: Configuration of Jupyter Notebooks
	- In the **Anaconda Terminal**, write `jupyter server --generate-config` and press enter. This, at least in Windows, should create a file to: `C:\Users\username\.jupyter\jupyter_server_config.py`.
	- Open the file with a text editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)), do a  `ctrl-f`  search for: `c.ServerApp.root_dir`, uncomment it by removing the and change it to `c.ServerApp.notebook_dir = 'C:\\your\\new\\path`, for example the directory where you created the `envs456` folder. In the University Machines, it is advised to work on the directory `M:\`. 
	- Save the file and close it.

### Start a Lab Session {.unnumbered}
1. Download the Jupyter Notebook of the session in your folder. Choose one jupyter notebook and click `Dowload raw file` as shown below

<img src = "../img/raw.png" width="80%">

2. Save the file in the `labs` folder within your `envs456` folder on your machine.
3. Type in the search bar, find and open the `Anaconda Prompt (miniconda 3)`. 
4. In the **Anaconda Terminal** write and run `conda activate envs456`.
5. In the **Anaconda Terminal** write and run `jupyter notebook`. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your default browser. 

<img src = "../img/jupyter.png" width="80%">

6. Navigate to your course folder in and double click on the notebook downloaded in step 1. 
7. You can now work on your copy of the notebook.


Follow these instructions and test your installation **prior to the first Lab Session** (Wed, 31st of January). If you experience any issues, write a message on the Ms Teams channel of the module.
Setting up the Python environment is necessary for:

- Executing the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) of the Lab sessions of the course.
- Preparing your own Jupyter Notebooks for the assignments (one each).

## Set up Miniconda (and Python) on MAC {.unnumbered}


### Installation {.unnumbered}

To install Miniconda on your personal laptop, Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).
During the installation, leave the default settings. In particular, when asked whom to "Install Miniconda for", choose "Just for me".

### Set up the Directories {.unnumbered}
1. Create a folder where you want to keep your work conducted throughout this course. For example, call it `envs456`. You can save it wherever you want. For example, Elisabetta has named her folder `envs456` and it's in her Dropbox in `Users/PIETROST/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/envs456`
2. Download the [data](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/data) and the [images](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/tree/main/labs_img) for running and rendering the jupyter notebooks. 
3. Unzip the folders and move the nested folders into the folder `envs456`.
4. Create another folder called `labs`

The folder structure should look like:

```
envs456/
├── data/
├── labs_img/
└── labs/
```

<img src = "../img/mac_folder.png" width="80%">

### Set up the Python Environment{.unnumbered}

1. Download the `envs456.yml` from GitHub by cliciking `Download raw file`, top right, [at this page](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/wma/blob/main/envs456.yml) 
2. Save it in the folder `envs456` created before.
2. Type in the search bar and open the **Terminal**. 
3. In the **Terminal** write `conda env create -n envs456 --file envs456.yml` and press `Enter`. This will need to be modified according to where you placed the `envs456` folder. For example, Elisabetta has named her folder `envs456` and it's in her Dropbox in `Users/PIETROST/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/envs456/envs456.yml`. If you created the `envs456` folder on your desktop, the path would be `Desktop/envs456`.
