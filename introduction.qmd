# Introduction

Dani Arribas-Bel

**Lecture**: Introduction to the module

**Lab**: Powerful examples & Discussion about interactive map

## Lecture

## Lab: Powerful examples

This lab has two main components:

1.  The first one will require you to find a partner and work together with her/him

2.  And the second one will involve group discussion.

### Paired activity

In pairs, find three examples where web maps are used to communicate an idea. Complete the following sheet for each example:

-   **Substantive**

    -   `Title`: Title of the map/project
    -   `Author`: Who is behind the project?
    -   `Big idea`: a "one-liner" on what the project tries to accomplish --
    -   `Message`: what does the map try to get accross

-   **Technical**

    -   `URL`:
    -   `Interactivity`: does the map let you interact with it in any way? Yes/No
    -   `Zoomable`: can you explore the map at different scales? Yes/No
    -   `Tooltips`:
    -   `Basemap`: Is there an underlying map providing geographical context? Yes/No. If so, who is it provided by?
    -   `Technology`: can you guess what technology does this map rely on?

Post each sheet as a separate item on the Teams channel for Lab No.1

As an example, below is the sheet for the project "WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard" !["WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard"](./img/who_covid.png)

-   **Substantive**

    -   `Title`: WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard

    -   `Author`: World Health Organization

    -   `Big idea`: Shows confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by country to date

    -   `Message`: The project displays a map of the world where COVID-19 cases are shown by country. This element is used to show which countries have had more cases (large trends). A drop down button allows us to visualise the map by a) Total per 100,000 population b) % change in the last 7 days c) newly reported in the last 7 days d) newly reported in the last 24 hours.

-   **Technical**

    -   `URL`: [`https://covid19.who.int/`](https://covid19.who.int/)

    -   `Interactivity`: Yes

    -   `Zoomable`: Yes

    -   `Tooltips`: Yes

    -   `Basemap`: No

    -   `Technology`: Unknown

Here are a couple of other COVID-19 examples of web-maps that where basemaps and technology is easier to spot.

### Class discussion

We will select a few examples posted and collectively discuss (some of) the following questions:

1.  What makes them powerful, what "speaks" to us?

2.  What could be improved, what is counter-intuitive?

3.  What design elements do they rely on?

4.  What technology do they use?
