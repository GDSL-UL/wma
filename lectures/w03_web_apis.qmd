# Today

-   A (brief an opinionated) history of the Web 
- The server/client model
- The modern web mapping eco-system

# A (brief and opinionated) history of Web trends

# Pre 1970s

The seeds:

- US (e.g. Licklider’s “Galactic Network”) 

- Mostly military contracts (e.g. D/ARPA –> ARPANET) and “research’y”

- Develop protocols for machine communication

# 1970s - Birth of the *internet*

# 1980s

- Growth of the “web”

- From experimental validation to scaled up insfrastructure

- Free software (e.g. “Free as in Freedom”)

# 1990s

- Civilian and commercial growth

- Web 1.0

- Open Source software (e.g. “The cathedral and the Bazaar”)

# 2000s

- Web 2.0

- Mobile

- Web mapping takes off (hello Google Maps!)

# 2010s

- Consolidation of GAFA –> concentration

- IoT

- Death of the desktop?

# Ideas to retain

- The Web is technology to build decentralised systems

- Economics (for the most part) have turned it into a concentrated economy

- Computing today is physically distributed but socio-economically concentrated

# Benefits

- Interoperability of disparate platforms

- Optimise on hard/software for each task (“distribute”)

- Separate data collection (e.g. sensor), storage (e.g. data centre), intensive computing (e.g. compute cluster), interaction (e.g. mobile)

# Disadvantages

- Requires (cheap & ubiquitous) connectivity 

- More complex than an isolated approach (e.g. desktop)

- Harder to “keep afloat”

# The current web mapping landscape

- **Software**: a lot of open-source projects 

- **Platforms**: a concentrated few (web infrastructure is hard and expensive!) 

- **Business model**: software as a service

# The current web mapping landscape
*Trade-off between*

**This course**: mostly rely on commercial platforms to focus on design and cartographic rather than engineering concepts

# What do APIs actually do?

 - Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") 
 - Instead of downloading a data set, APIs allow programmers, statisticians
(or students) to request data directly from a server to a local machine.

When you work with web APIs, two different computers 
- **a client and server** - will interact with each other to request and provide data,
respectively.

# RESTful Web APIs are all around you.

**Web APIs**

-   Allow you query a remote database over the internet

-   Take on a variety of formats

-   Adhere to a particular style known as Representation State Transfer
    or REST (in most cases)

-   RESTful APIs are convenient because we use them to query database
    using URLs
    
# Two ways to collect data 

**Plug-n-play packages.** Many common APIs are available through
user-written Py libraries.

**Writing our own API request.** If no wrapper function is available, we
have to write our own API request and format the response ourselves.
